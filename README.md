# Spider -- Radionuclide Therapy Patient Dosimetry

Spider is a software pipeline for estimating patient radiation dose
from radionuclide therapy based on multiple time-point imaging.

## SNMMI Lu-177 Dosimetry Challenge 2021

Spider's performance can be evaluated by executing it on the image
dataset from the [SNMMI Lu-177 Dosimetry Challenge
2021](https://snmmi.org/Therapy/SNMMI-THERAPY/Dosimetry_Challenge.aspx)
(hereafter referred to as the benchmark dataset).
Pass CMake the flag `-DSPIDER_BUILD_BENCHMARKS=ON` to download the
benchmark dataset and build the script `benchmark/tia.sh`.
Run this script with

```sh
./tia.sh
```

to excecute Spider on the benchmark dataset.
Note that running this script requires the external programs
[dcm2niix](https://www.nitrc.org/plugins/mwiki/index.php/dcm2nii:MainPage),
[elastix](https://elastix.dev/), and
[gnuplot](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuplot/).
The output includes a comparison of the time-integrated activity image
generated by Spider with the one included in the benchmark dataset.

Spider can also be executed on the benchmark dataset using [GNU
Guix](https://guix.gnu.org) with the command:

```sh
guix build -f benchmark/tia.scm
```
